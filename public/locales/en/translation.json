        },
        {
          "question": "Who must comply with CCPA?",
          "answer": "CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that collect California residents' personal information and meet at least one threshold: annual gross revenue over $25 million, buy/sell/share data of 100,000+ consumers or devices, or derive 50%+ of annual revenue from selling personal information."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the penalties for CCPA violations?",
          "answer": "CCPA violations can result in civil penalties of $2,500 per unintentional violation and $7,500 per intentional violation. Additionally, consumers have a private right of action for data breaches, with statutory damages of $100-$750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages if greater."
        },
        {
          "question": "What consumer rights does CCPA provide?",
          "answer": "CCPA provides four main rights: the right to know what personal information is collected and how it's used, the right to delete personal information, the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information, and the right to non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights."
