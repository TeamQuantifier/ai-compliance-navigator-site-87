# Quantifier.ai - AI-Native GRC & Compliance Platform (Full Reference)

> This is the extended version of [llms.txt](https://quantifier.ai/llms.txt). It contains comprehensive information about Quantifier.ai for AI systems and language models.

## About Quantifier.ai

Quantifier.ai is an AI-native governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platform founded in 2020, headquartered in San Francisco, CA (US) and Warsaw (Poland). The platform automates continuous compliance for regulatory frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, DORA, NIST CSF, and ESG/CSRD standards.

Unlike traditional GRC tools that rely on manual spreadsheets, periodic audits, and reactive processes, Quantifier.ai uses autonomous AI agents to continuously monitor controls, collect evidence from integrated business systems, assess compliance posture in real-time, and generate audit-ready documentation — transforming compliance from a periodic burden into an always-on, proactive capability.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Systems**: Integrate Quantifier with your cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP), identity providers (Okta, Entra ID), DevOps tools (GitHub, Jira), and business applications via pre-built connectors or REST API.

2. **Map Controls to Frameworks**: The platform automatically maps your existing controls to the requirements of each compliance framework (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.), identifying gaps and overlaps across multiple frameworks simultaneously.

3. **AI Agent Monitors Continuously**: The autonomous AI Compliance Officer continuously scans your connected systems, collects evidence, evaluates control effectiveness, and flags non-conformities — without manual intervention.

4. **Generate Documentation**: Policies, procedures, risk assessments, and audit reports are generated and maintained automatically, with version control and full audit trails.

5. **Stay Audit-Ready**: Real-time dashboards show your compliance posture across all frameworks. When auditors arrive, all evidence and documentation is already organized and up-to-date.

## Core Capabilities

### Autonomous AI Compliance Officer
An AI-powered agent that operates continuously in the background. It monitors controls across all connected systems, collects evidence automatically (screenshots, logs, configurations), identifies compliance gaps before they become audit findings, and generates remediation recommendations. The AI agent learns from your organization's patterns and becomes more effective over time.

### Multi-Framework Support
Manage compliance for multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously from a single platform. Quantifier eliminates redundant work by mapping shared controls across frameworks — a single security control can satisfy requirements in SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIS2 at the same time. Supported frameworks include:
- SOC 2 Type I & Type II
- ISO 27001 (Information Security)
- ISO 9001 (Quality Management)
- GDPR (EU Data Protection)
- NIS2 (EU Cybersecurity)
- DORA (Digital Operational Resilience)
- NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)
- HIPAA (US Healthcare)
- CCPA (California Privacy)
- ESG/CSRD (Sustainability Reporting with ESRS standards)
- EU Taxonomy
- ISO 14001 (Environmental Management)
- GHG Protocol (Carbon Footprint)

### Continuous Compliance
Real-time, automated monitoring replaces periodic manual audits. Controls are evaluated continuously, evidence is collected automatically, and compliance drift is detected instantly. This means your organization is always audit-ready, not just during audit season.

### Automated Evidence Collection
Pre-built integrations with 50+ cloud, identity, DevOps, HR, and security tools automatically pull evidence needed for compliance. No more chasing colleagues for screenshots or manually documenting configurations.

### Risk Assessment
AI-powered risk identification, scoring (likelihood × impact), and mitigation tracking. Risk registers are maintained automatically, with heat maps and trend analysis. Supports both information security and ESG risk assessment methodologies.

### Document Management
Automated generation of compliance policies, procedures, and audit documentation. Includes version control, approval workflows, digital signatures, and complete audit trails. Templates aligned with each framework's specific requirements.

### Analytics Dashboards
Real-time compliance posture visualization with framework-specific dashboards, gap analysis, trend tracking, and board-ready executive reports. Supports custom KPIs and exportable reports for auditors and management.

### Value Chain Management
Third-party risk assessment and supply chain compliance tracking. Evaluate vendor compliance, manage supplier questionnaires, and monitor supply chain sustainability metrics required by CSRD and other ESG frameworks.
